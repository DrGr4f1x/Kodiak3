General
** Move m_framebuffers into Application base class - everything uses this, don't need to set it up individually
** Fix flipped y-axis in Vulkan viewport
** Camera movement/controls/use of Camera class for all Apps
** Get CameraController to respect initial camera orientation (extract initial pitch and heading)
** Implement an orbit camera mode

Demo bugs/improvements
Displacement - Investigate/fix busted rendering in DX12 on AMD (compiling with dxc)
** StencilBuffer - Fix busted StencilBuffer outline in VK
** RadialBlur - Fix inverted blur UVs in Vulkan
ComputeNBody - Figure out how to do an *exact* VS/GS replacement for gl_pointsize

General bugs/improvements
- Standardize naming in shaders (e.g. pos vs position, uv vs texcoord, etc)
- Handle window resizing, etc.
- Use inverted Z in all demos
- Cleanup both GraphicsDevices to explicitly support 2 roles
  * Initial API setup
  * API creation
- Refactor command context recycling to use fences explicitly
- Refactor/replace math library
- Make a few basic shaders for meshes that can be re-used.
- Camera focus on bounding box, bounding sphere
- Split graphics code into 2 layers (GLI - low-level API wrapper, and Renderer - higher level, e.g. Model, Texture, Effect, etc.)
- Make structs/classes for several common vertex formats
- Figure out how to do an Effect interface similar to DirectXTK
- Finish basic model factory (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, etc.)
- Revisit the linear allocator strategy for 'immediate' descriptor setting ala MiniEngine
- Async loader/object creator

Shader Compiler
** Add logging to shader compiler
- Refactor shader compilation to work similar to DirectXTK

Debug rendering
- Lines, grid, text in 3d space
- Vectors
- Bounding boxes
- Debug console

Vulkan
** Replace HandleVk with RefCountingVk
- Use an explicit loader/dispatcher for all Vk API calls
- Always enable all available features (VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2)
- Refactor extension handling
- Autogenerate loader/dispatcher, refcounting, extensions from vulkan registry xml
- Refcount remaining objects (rootsig, pipeline state, command buffers, etc)
- Rationalize the inverted viewport situation

DX12
- Fix DX12 constant buffer Create() w/ initial data (use DisplacementApp m_hsConstantBuffer as easy test)
